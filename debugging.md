mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 --default-artifact-root s3://mlflow-bucket-1988
after this command aws ec2 machine shows command mflow not found try sudo apt install <deb name>

The error message you‚Äôre seeing ‚Äî `mlflow: command not found` ‚Äî means that the EC2 instance doesn‚Äôt have the `mlflow` CLI installed yet.

Here‚Äôs how you can fix this step-by-step on your AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu-based, assuming that's your OS):

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Python and pip (if not already installed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Install MLflow using pip

```bash
pip3 install mlflow
```

If you want `mlflow` to be available system-wide and not just for the current user, add:

```bash
sudo pip3 install mlflow
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify installation

```bash
mlflow --version
```

You should see the installed version number.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Run the MLflow tracking server (as you intended)

Make sure AWS CLI is configured and you have permission to write to your S3 bucket (`mlflow-bucket-1988`).

```bash
mlflow server \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --default-artifact-root s3://mlflow-bucket-1988 \
  --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

---

### Optional:

If you're deploying in production, consider:

* Using **`gunicorn`** or **`nginx`** as a reverse proxy.
* Running the server with **`nohup`** or as a **`systemd`** service.
* Securing access using **IAM roles** or **environment variables** for S3 access.
* Replacing `sqlite` with **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for scalable metadata storage.

Would you like a full `systemd` setup or Docker-based deployment for MLflow on EC2?


 aws configure
bash: aws: command not found

The error `bash: aws: command not found` means the AWS CLI is not installed on your EC2 instance.

Here‚Äôs how to **install and configure AWS CLI v2** on Ubuntu EC2 step-by-step:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install AWS CLI v2

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Verify installation

```bash
aws --version
```

You should see something like:

```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Linux/x86_64
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Configure AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

You‚Äôll be prompted for:

* `AWS Access Key ID`
* `AWS Secret Access Key`
* `Default region name` (e.g., `us-east-1`)
* `Default output format` (you can type `json` or just press enter)

> üîê **Security Tip:** If you're using an EC2 instance with an IAM role assigned, you can skip `aws configure`. The CLI will automatically use the role‚Äôs permissions.

---

Would you like help attaching an IAM role to the EC2 instance so it can access S3 securely without storing credentials?


Here's how to **install and configure AWS CLI v2 on Windows** step by step:

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Download AWS CLI Installer

1. Go to the official AWS CLI v2 download page:
   üëâ [https://aws.amazon.com/cli/](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

2. Click on **‚ÄúWindows 64-bit‚Äù** installer to download the `.msi` file directly, or use this direct link:
   üëâ [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Install AWS CLI

1. Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file.
2. Follow the wizard to complete installation (Next ‚Üí Accept License ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Finish).

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Installation

Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```bash
aws --version
```

Expected output:

```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Windows/10 exe/x86_64
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Configure AWS CLI

In the same terminal, run:

```bash
aws configure
```

Then enter:

* **AWS Access Key ID**: `<your-access-key>`
* **AWS Secret Access Key**: `<your-secret-key>`
* **Default region name**: e.g., `us-east-1`
* **Default output format**: `json` (or just press Enter)

‚úÖ Done! Now you can use `aws s3`, `aws ec2`, `aws configure`, etc.

---

### üîê Optional (Recommended for EC2):

If you‚Äôre on an EC2 instance with an IAM role assigned, you **don‚Äôt need to run `aws configure`** ‚Äî the AWS CLI will automatically use the IAM role's credentials.

---

Would you like to also configure **MLflow on Windows with S3 support** or run it inside **Anaconda or Docker**?


Got it ‚Äî you installed AWS CLI on **Windows**, but you're still getting:

```bash
aws: command not found
```

Let‚Äôs fix that. This usually happens because the AWS CLI path is **not added to your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable**. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step fix:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix on Windows

### üîé Step 1: Check If AWS CLI is Installed

First, go to this folder in File Explorer:

```
C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\
```

You should see a file named `aws.exe` inside the `AWSCLIV2` folder.
‚úÖ If it exists, the CLI is installed correctly ‚Äî we just need to fix the system PATH.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Add AWS CLI to System PATH

1. Press **Windows Key + S** ‚Üí type `Environment Variables` ‚Üí click **"Edit the system environment variables"**.

2. In the **System Properties** window, click **"Environment Variables..."**

3. In the **System Variables** section, scroll down and select `Path`, then click **Edit...**

4. Click **New** and paste this path:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\
   ```

5. Click **OK** ‚Üí OK ‚Üí OK to close all windows.

---

### üîÅ Step 3: Restart Terminal

* Close all Command Prompt / PowerShell windows.
* Open a new **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, and run:

```bash
aws --version
```

You should now see something like:

```
aws-cli/2.15.30 Python/3.11.7 Windows/10 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

---

## ‚úÖ Still not working?

Try running the AWS CLI directly:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\aws.exe" --version
```

If that works, then it's definitely a PATH issue.

---

Let me know if you're using **Git Bash**, **Anaconda Prompt**, or **WSL** ‚Äî those require slightly different setups.

Thanks for the update. Let‚Äôs troubleshoot this thoroughly.

---

### üîç Confirm These First

1. **Did you install the CLI as Administrator?**

   * If not, uninstall it and **reinstall the `.msi` as Admin** (right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator).

2. **Can you run it directly from the install location?**
   Open **Command Prompt** and try:

   ```bash
   "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\aws.exe" --version
   ```

   * ‚úÖ If this works, then it **is installed correctly**, and the **PATH variable is not configured properly**.

---

### üîß Fix the PATH Manually (Again, but carefully)

#### Step-by-step to set PATH **system-wide**:

1. **Search**: `Environment Variables` ‚Üí click **‚ÄúEdit the system environment variables‚Äù**.
2. Click **‚ÄúEnvironment Variables‚Äù**.
3. In the bottom **System variables** section, find and **select `Path`**, then click **Edit...**
4. Click **New**, then add:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\
   ```
5. Make sure there is no typo and that this **exact path exists**.
6. Click **OK** multiple times to close all dialog boxes.

> üîÑ **Important**: Close all terminals and open a **new Command Prompt** (not PowerShell or Git Bash yet) and test:

```bash
aws --version
```

---

### ‚úÖ If you want it to work in PowerShell or Git Bash too:

#### For Git Bash:

1. Open Git Bash
2. Run:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2"
   ```
3. Now try:

   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```

To make it permanent in Git Bash, add that `export PATH=...` line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.

---

### üß™ Final Fallback Test

Paste this into a Command Prompt window (not PowerShell):

```bash
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2;%PATH%
aws --version
```

If that works, the PATH isn't permanently updated. We can script it if needed.

---

Would you like me to give you a **script to auto-add AWS CLI to your system PATH** or help with a Docker-based MLflow setup instead (avoids these issues)?


it found in cmd but not in venv bash terminal
Thanks ‚Äî now it's clear:
‚úÖ `aws` works in **Command Prompt**
‚ùå But **not in your virtual environment's Bash terminal** (like Git Bash or WSL or VS Code terminal using venv).

This is a **common issue**: the venv doesn't inherit your system `PATH`, or the Bash shell doesn't see global binaries like `aws.exe`.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Manually add AWS CLI to your Bash `PATH` (temporary)

In your **Bash terminal**, run:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2"
```

Then test:

```bash
aws --version
```

This will work **only for this terminal session**.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Make it permanent (for Git Bash or venv Bash)

### üîß If you're using **Git Bash or Anaconda Prompt**:

1. Open Git Bash
2. Edit your Bash profile:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. Add this line at the end:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2"
   ```
4. Save and exit (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`)
5. Reload the config:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Now `aws` should work in all future Git Bash sessions ‚Äî even inside a Python virtual environment (`venv`).

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Symlink (if you're using WSL or Linux Bash)

If you're using WSL, it's better to install the AWS CLI natively inside WSL using:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 4: Use full path in scripts

If you don't want to mess with the environment, you can call AWS CLI like this from inside your scripts or MLflow config:

```bash
"/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2/aws.exe" s3 ls
```

---

Let me know:

* Are you using Git Bash, Anaconda Prompt, WSL, or VS Code Terminal?
* Do you want a permanent fix for all environments or just a quick patch for now?

GNU nano 8.2                                 /c/Users/surface/.bashrc
. /c/ProgramData/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate base
alias gst='git status'





                                                 [ Read 3 lines ]
^G Help         ^O Write Out    ^F Where Is     ^K Cut          ^T Execute      ^C Location     M-U Undo
^X Exit         ^R Read File    ^\ Replace      ^U Paste        ^J Justify      ^/ Go To Line   M-E Redo

Perfect ‚Äî you're editing your **Git Bash `~/.bashrc`** file. Now let‚Äôs permanently add the AWS CLI path so it works in Git Bash and all terminals, even inside virtual environments like `venv`.

---

## ‚úÖ What to Do Now

### ‚ûï Add this line to your `.bashrc` (below your current lines):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2"
```

So your updated `.bashrc` will look like this:

```bash
. /c/ProgramData/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate base
alias gst='git status'
export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Amazon/AWSCLIV2"
```

---

### üíæ Save and Exit from nano:

* Press `Ctrl + O` ‚Üí Enter (to save)
* Then `Ctrl + X` (to exit)

---

### üîÑ Apply changes immediately:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test it:

```bash
aws --version
```

Expected output (or similar):

```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Windows/10 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

---

From now on, `aws` will work in **Git Bash**, **venv**, **Conda**, and any Bash session you start.

Would you also like help integrating this with your MLflow project in a virtual environment or container?

ERROR: failed to reproduce 'model_evaluation': output 'experiment_info.json' does not exist
(youtube) 

You're very close ‚Äî your DVC + MLflow pipeline is working, but there's one clear error causing the `model_evaluation` stage to fail:

---

### ‚ùå Error Breakdown:

```
An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the PutObject operation:
The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.
```

This means:

* MLflow is trying to **log artifacts to S3**.
* But AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret) are **invalid or missing** in the current environment (`youtube` venv).
* As a result, MLflow **cannot upload artifacts to your S3 bucket** (`mlflow-bucket-1988`).

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Options

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Set AWS credentials for the `youtube` environment

In your terminal, activate your virtual environment (`youtube`) and run:

```bash
aws configure
```

> This will write the keys to `~/.aws/credentials` so MLflow and Boto3 can access them.

If you don‚Äôt want to use `aws configure`, you can set the credentials directly in your environment like so:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

If you're using **Windows CMD**, use:

```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

And for **PowerShell**:

```powershell
$env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_id"
$env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key"
$env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-north-1"
```

---

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Use IAM role (EC2 only ‚Äì best practice)

If you're running this on an **AWS EC2 instance**, it‚Äôs better to:

1. Go to **EC2 Console ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí Select your instance**
2. Click **Actions ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Modify IAM Role**
3. Attach a role that has `AmazonS3FullAccess` or restricted `PutObject` permissions to your S3 bucket
4. **No need to configure credentials manually**

Then MLflow will automatically use the IAM role.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Step: Rerun DVC

Once AWS credentials are working, rerun:

```bash
dvc repro
```

This time the `model_evaluation` stage should complete and `experiment_info.json` will be created.

---

### üß† Bonus Tip: To test if AWS access works in Python

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3")
s3.list_buckets()  # should succeed if credentials are valid
```

---

Want help setting up **a `.env` file or credentials profile** so it works securely and automatically every time?


i have done above activities and found the following

Great ‚Äî you've followed the AWS credential setup. Now let‚Äôs look at the **new error or result you encountered**.

But I need you to **paste the new output or error log** from your terminal after doing the steps ‚Äî especially after you ran:

```bash
dvc repro
```

Please share:

1. The **latest output or error message**
2. Whether you're running on:

   * A local Windows machine, or
   * An EC2 instance with IAM role
3. Whether you used:

   * `aws configure`, or
   * Environment variables (like `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...`)
   * or IAM role

Once I have that, I can precisely tell you what's going wrong (if anything) or confirm that it's working now.


Thanks ‚Äî this confirms the root issue is still:

---

### ‚ùå **AWS Credentials not recognized**

```
An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the PutObject operation: 
The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.
```

Despite your efforts, MLflow (and boto3 underneath) cannot see **valid AWS credentials** inside your `youtube` Conda environment **in Git Bash on Windows**.

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Likely Happening

On Windows Git Bash + Conda env:

* Even if you ran `aws configure` in **CMD**, that **may not propagate** into Git Bash.
* Also, Conda sometimes **isolates environments** and doesn't pass system environment variables into Python or subprocesses.
* So MLflow can‚Äôt access `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables unless we **manually expose them**.

---

## ‚úÖ Reliable Fix (Permanent): Add AWS credentials to `~/.bashrc` or activate script

### üîê Step 1: Edit your `~/.bashrc` (you already know how)

Add your AWS credentials like this **at the bottom**:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

Example:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA123456EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

Then:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### üí° Step 2 (Optional): Add it to `conda activate` script

If you prefer activating credentials **only inside the `youtube` environment**, do this:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d
nano ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
```

Paste in:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

Then:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
conda deactivate && conda activate youtube
```

Now `mlflow`, `boto3`, and `aws` in that environment will all work.

---

### ‚úÖ Finally: Test it manually before running `dvc`

Try:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://mlflow-bucket-1988
```

If this command works without error, then your credentials are working and MLflow will succeed.

---

Let me know if you'd like to use **a `.env` file**, **AWS profiles**, or **IAM roles with EC2** instead ‚Äî all are cleaner options for deployment.


aws s3 ls s3://mlflow-bucket-1988
                           PRE 1/
                           PRE 2/
                           PRE 3/
                           PRE 4/
‚Üê]633;P;Cwd=C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/Library/e/DS-Projects-Vault/projects/reddit-sentiment-analysis-ml-ds-deployment(base) 

Perfect ‚Äî this confirms it:

‚úÖ **Your AWS credentials are now working correctly**,
‚úÖ **Access to the S3 bucket `mlflow-bucket-1988` is verified**,
‚ùå **But MLflow inside your `youtube` environment still fails** ‚Üí that suggests the environment **doesn't inherit** your working AWS setup yet.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Fix: Ensure MLflow in `youtube` environment sees AWS credentials

Now that `aws s3 ls` works in the base environment, do **one of the following** to make it work in `youtube`:

---

### üîÅ **Option A (Recommended): Inherit global AWS credentials**

In Git Bash, copy your AWS credentials to where MLflow can read them:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aws
cp /c/Users/surface/.aws/credentials ~/.aws/credentials
cp /c/Users/surface/.aws/config ~/.aws/config
```

Then activate your environment again:

```bash
conda activate youtube
```

Now rerun:

```bash
dvc repro
```

---

### üîÅ **Option B: Export variables directly inside the environment**

If copying `.aws` doesn't work, export credentials manually after activating `youtube`:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

Or, automate it by creating:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d
nano ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d/aws_env.sh
```

Paste:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-north-1
```

Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.conda/envs/youtube/etc/conda/activate.d/aws_env.sh
```

Then run:

```bash
conda deactivate && conda activate youtube
dvc repro
```

---

## üß™ Want to test before rerunning `dvc`?

Inside the `youtube` env, test:

```bash
python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.client('s3').list_buckets())"
```

If this works without `InvalidAccessKeyId`, your MLflow run should work too.

---

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a `.env` file‚Äìbased method using `python-dotenv`, or to containerize the whole thing for consistency.
